This was a report for me (Arnab) and another classmates final project in CS590AF: Reverse Engineering and Exploit Development at Univeristy of Massachusetts Amherst.

We analyzed an old use after free that was present within the Linux kernel.

I primarily did most of the reversing in regards to fully understanding what our PoC exploit did and how it led to the conditions created for the UAF to occur.
